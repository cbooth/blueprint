# Contributing

Hi! Thanks for wanting to contribute! This project is pretty small and I doubt it will go very far, it was purely made as a tool I was going to use internally so it's written pretty... sloppily.

We'll use a (Rails-esque contributor policy)[https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md]:
- If you find a bug, report it in the issues tab if it isn't already in there
- If you've patched out the bug, feel free to submit a pull request
- If you make a cosmetic change, it won't be accepted (everyone has their own personal style)
- If you add a new feature, submit a PR with it and I'll take a look

And that's about it!
